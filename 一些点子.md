## 重要收获

1. Phenotypic features were extracted for each cell under DMSO control or drug/compound perturbations (e.g. Gemcitabine). 
 2. Drug/compound effects on each feature at population level (compared to DMSO) were summarized by KS statistics. 
 3. A phenotypic profile of a drug/compound (at single time point) consists of KS statistics of all features, 
 and can be visualized as a point in high-dimensional feature space. 4. Phenotypic profiles can be extended to multiple time point. 
Dynamics of drug/compound effects were visualized as “time-traces” in the feature space.

after reading this, I just knew that actually ks number is calculated based on comparison with(dmso).
It inspired me that sometimes when it is hard to use a number to measure a level of something, you can refer to another thing that already exists as a 
comparison(as a baseline)
